
Here you will find the information necessary to successfully use a Ziti SDK to create an application. If there is a term

Each SDK has certain syntax unique to the particular language the SDK is targetting. Each SDK presents an api which is
as idomatic as possible to present a consistent look and feel for the language or runtime being used.
